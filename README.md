# Missing Error Handling in Express.js Route

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications: inadequate error handling for database interactions and invalid input.

The `bug.js` file showcases the problematic code.  The route `/users/:id` attempts to fetch a user from a database.  However, it lacks proper error handling for scenarios like:

* Database connection errors
* Invalid user IDs
* Errors during data retrieval

The absence of robust error handling results in generic 500 errors being sent to clients, providing no useful information for debugging.

`bugSolution.js` provides a corrected version with comprehensive error handling, demonstrating best practices for handling potential issues in Express.js routes.
